Project 1: Create a "5C-Twitter Bot"using the Twitter API that sends out useful tweets about living in claremont.
Do backend things in Python and/or Node.js
  Ideas:
  * Send out Daily Weather/Traffic Updates for Claremont/Mt Baldy/Beach/J-Tree / Financial index news
  * Scrape data from 5C menu sites / Give meal recommendations
  * Have interactive component / replies to tweets
  * Send Responses to Questions, maybe about Open/Close times


Project 2:  We were thinking of making an app that allows the user get a reservation for a restaurant and look at the menu. 
Once they are seated they can order and pay. The app would work by using existing software that can 
find the user's location and look for restaurants close by. Once the user has found the restaurant, 
they can order the food and quantity and the restaurant will be notified of the order. The goal is to make an application
that will allow for a quick dine-in expeience.

Project 3: In this idea we were planning on creating an application or website that is for 5c students to post their 
on so they can share and exchange textbooks at a lower price than alternative sites. In addition, we want to implement
a filter/search for the textbooks so it's also easier for the user to find their desired product.
