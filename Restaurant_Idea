Project Idea 1: We were thinking of making an app that allows the user get a reservation for a restaurant and look at the menu. 
Once they are seated they can order and pay. The app would work by using existing software that can 
find the user's location and look for restaurants close by. Once the user has found the restaurant, 
they can order the food and quantity and the restaurant will be notified of the order. The goal is to make an application
that will allow for a quick dine-in expeience.
